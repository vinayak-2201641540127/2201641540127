URL Shortener Microservice – Demonstration
1. Console

    Backend logs confirm that requests are processed and logging middleware is working:
    
    Short URL creation logged with details.
    
    Stats retrieval logged when requested.

    ✅ Console clearly shows the lifecycle of each request.



2. Postman
      (a) Shortening the URL
      
      Endpoint: POST /shorten
      
      Input: Long URL with optional validity.
      
      Output: Returns generated shortCode, full shortUrl, and expiry time.

      ✅ API successfully creates a short link.



      (b) Short URL Stats
      
      Endpoint: GET /stats/:shortCode
      
      Output: JSON with shortCode, originalUrl, createdAt, clicks, and expiry.

      ✅ API correctly fetches statistics for the given short link.




3. MongoDB

      Database stores records with all required fields:
      
      shortCode (unique)
      
      originalUrl
      
      createdAt
      
      expiry
      
      clicks
      
      <img width="1572" height="776" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d435848-6b76-447e-9e37-03ee5a3cf2bc" />


      ✅ Data model matches the design document, and records persist as expected.



✅ Summary

  📌 Console → Logs lifecycle of requests
  
  📌 Postman → Verified shorten & stats endpoints
  
  📌 MongoDB → Schema-compliant storage with expiry & click tracking
  
  👉 The system is working end-to-end as intended.
